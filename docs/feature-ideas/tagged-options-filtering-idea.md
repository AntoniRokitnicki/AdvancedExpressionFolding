# Feature Idea: Tagged Options with Filter

## Current State
Every folding option is presented the same way with a checkbox and description.
Users must scan the entire list or rely on external documentation to find features relevant to a technology or theme.

## Proposal
Introduce tag metadata for each option (e.g. `#java`, `#kotlin`, `#experimental`).
Add a tag-based filter UI so users can show only matching options or combine tags.
This would help quickly surface settings tied to a language, framework, or usage context.
