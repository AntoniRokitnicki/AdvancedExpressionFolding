# Feature Idea: Tree Checkbox View with Search Filter

## Current State
The settings screen lists all checkboxes sequentially without built-in search.
Finding a specific option requires manual scrolling and visual scanning.

## Proposal
Combine a hierarchical checkbox tree with a live search field.
Typing in the search box would filter nodes, expanding matching branches and dimming others.
This hybrid view offers both structured grouping and instant text search for precise navigation.
