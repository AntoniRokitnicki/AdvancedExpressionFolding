# Feature Idea: Java 21 Pattern & Record Folding

**Hook:** Keep modern Java readable by collapsing record constructors, pattern matching, and string templates.

**Why now?** Java 21 LTS is landing in enterprise stacks; early support prevents churn.

**Lift-Cost Score:** M

**Starter spec:**
- Extend parser to handle record components and pattern switches.
- Add folding descriptors for string template expressions.
- Supply tests covering Java 21 syntax cases.
