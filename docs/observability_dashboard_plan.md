# Observability Dashboard Plan

## Optimized Solution Overview
- **Data Intake Layer**: Ship metrics, logs, and traces through language-specific SDKs and sidecars into a Kafka-backed ingestion bus with schema validation to prevent malformed payloads.
- **Processing & Storage**: Use a streaming job (Apache Flink) to normalize events, write hot metrics to a time-series database (ClickHouse) and persisted logs/traces to S3-backed object storage indexed by OpenSearch.
- **Visualization UI**: React-based frontend backed by GraphQL gateway that federates metrics, logs, and trace queries; supports templated dashboards, drilldowns, and correlation widgets.
- **Alerting & Automation**: Rules-as-code repository compiled into Prometheus-compatible alert rules and routed through Alertmanager with ChatOps + ticketing hooks.
- **Governance & Reliability**: Terraform-managed infrastructure, feature flags for gradual rollout, audit logging, and golden-path runbooks stored with the dashboards.
