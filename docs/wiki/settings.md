# Settings

The **Advanced Expression Folding 2** settings page now includes dedicated bulk action buttons:

- **Enable all** – marks every folding option available in the configurable for activation.
- **Disable all** – clears every folding option, allowing you to quickly start from a clean slate.
- **Restore defaults** – resets every option to the plugin's recommended defaults.

After using either button the checkbox list refreshes immediately, so you can review the selected options before applying the changes.
