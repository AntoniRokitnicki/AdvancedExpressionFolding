# Feature Idea: Profile-Based Folding Presets

**Hook:** Switch between "Read," "Debug," and "Review" folding modes with one click.

**Why now?** Different tasks demand different levels of verbosity; manual toggling is tedious.

**Lift-Cost Score:** L

**Starter spec:**
- Predefine three presets mapping to groups of rules.
- Offer quick-switch button in the status bar.
- Allow users to clone and customize presets.
- Add checkbox (default ON) to auto-disable folding during debug sessions.
