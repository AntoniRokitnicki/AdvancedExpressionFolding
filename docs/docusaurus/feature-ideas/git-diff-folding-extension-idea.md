# Feature Idea: Git Diff Folding Extension

**Hook:** Review diffs with collapsed boilerplate directly inside the IDE.

**Why now?** Code reviews slow down when every getter and import shows up.

**Lift-Cost Score:** M

**Starter spec:**
- Integrate folding engine with IntelliJ diff viewer.
- Respect active folding presets during review.
- Add shortcut to show/hide all foldings in diff.
