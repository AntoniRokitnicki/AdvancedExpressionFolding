Advanced Expression Folding upgrades code folding inside JetBrains IDEs so that Java reads closer to concise JVM languages such as Kotlin or Groovy. The plugin rewrites boilerplate-heavy constructs—getters, builders, guard clauses, logging statements—into compact placeholders without touching the underlying source.

Use this site as the canonical reference for every folding toggle that appears in the plugin settings dialog. The **Folding Options** section mirrors the settings panel and links to hands-on examples, while **Feature Guides** dive into the most opinionated behaviours with screenshots, videos, and configuration notes. Experimental concepts that have not shipped yet live under **Feature Ideas**.

If you are new to the plugin, start with the Folding Options overview to see everything that can be toggled. Advanced users may want to skip directly to a feature guide when exploring a specific folding mode. Each page links back to the matching sample in the `examples/` and `folded/` directories so you can inspect the before-and-after code inside the repository.

> Tip: In the IDE, adjust **Settings → Editor → Color Scheme → General → Code → Folded text** to improve contrast between folded placeholders and the rest of the code.
