description: Configure keymaps and IDE actions that apply folding globally.

Enable the **Global folding actions** switch to install two IDE actions that fold or unfold every supported construct inside the current editor. They appear in the *Advanced Expression Folding* group inside the Keymap preferences, so you can bind shortcuts that match your workflow.

![Keymap actions configured for folding and unfolding](https://github.com/AntoniRokitnicki/AdvancedExpressionFolding/assets/3055326/35863f50-d441-4402-8172-db6e75962350)

The actions respect the per-feature toggles from the settings page. For example, if Lombok folding is disabled, invoking the global shortcut will leave Lombok sections untouched.
