# Beginner Onboarding Tour

New to Advanced Expression Folding? Spend a minute with this tour to understand the core controls that keep folded code readable.

## 1. Review the folding settings
- Go to **Settings | Editor | Code Folding | Advanced Expression Folding 2**.
- The checklist is grouped so you can toggle only the features you care about.
- Use **Enable all** or **Disable all** to compare the extremes, then keep just what you like.

## 2. Experiment with real examples
- In the settings panel, use **Checkout Examples to Current Project**.
- The plugin adds runnable sample files so you can inspect fold hints without touching production code.

## 3. Control folding from the menu
- Use **Code | Advanced Expression Folding | Folding On/Off** to flip the global switch as you read through code.
- The **Global toggle** action is safeâ€”your actual source stays untouched.

## Need a reset?
- Press **Restore defaults** in the settings page to get back to the recommended baseline.

Once you finish these steps the plugin keeps folding silently, so you can focus on the logic instead of boilerplate.
