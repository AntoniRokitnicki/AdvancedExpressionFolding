# Prototype DSL Sandbox with Rollback Simulator Plan

## Stage 0 — Warm-Up
- The seed demands a prototype sandbox where a domain-specific language can be tested safely with rollback capabilities. We need both an execution harness and a simulator that reverts states.

## Stage 1 — Ideation Loop

### Cycle 1
**Visionary Futurist (functional paradigm, biology analogy):** Envision a pure function pipeline where every DSL command is like a cell signaling pathway, with immutable snapshots enabling deterministic rewinds; tension point: prove functional purity won’t strangle I/O-heavy tooling.
**Seasoned Architect (object-oriented paradigm, urban planning analogy):** Layer sandbox modules like zoning districts—parsers, interpreter, state ledger—encapsulated in classes that negotiate interfaces; tension point: ensure we can enforce encapsulation without drowning in boilerplate.
**Improvisational Artist (reactive paradigm, pop fiction analogy):** Picture observable streams similar to the time-loop narrative in *Edge of Tomorrow*, where rollbacks replay emissions to inspect divergent futures; tension point: decide how granular reactive updates should be before it becomes noise.
**Skeptical Critic (logic programming paradigm, biology analogy):** Challenge assumptions by introducing rule-based constraints that validate DSL mutations like immune responses rejecting pathogens; tension point: identify how to reconcile rule conflicts with deterministic rollbacks.
**Curious Beginner (procedural paradigm, urban planning analogy):** Ask for a simple step-by-step sandbox tour like following city transit lines so every rollback station is clearly labeled; tension point: clarify which steps must be exposed to the learner versus hidden behind automation.

### Cycle 2
**Visionary Futurist (actor model, pop fiction analogy):** Model each execution context as actors akin to starship crews coordinating via message passing to synchronize rollbacks; tension point: validate actor isolation when shared resources appear.
**Seasoned Architect (component-based paradigm, biology analogy):** Assemble sandbox components like modular organs that plug into a circulatory backbone handling state diffs; tension point: specify the contract for swapping organs without triggering rejection.
**Improvisational Artist (dataflow paradigm, urban planning analogy):** Imagine rollback timelines as traffic roundabouts rerouting cars along dataflow edges; tension point: map how data tokens carry metadata for auditing.
**Skeptical Critic (constraint-oriented paradigm, pop fiction analogy):** Impose temporal paradox checks like in *Back to the Future* so conflicting rollbacks raise immediate alerts; tension point: prove the paradox detector isn’t overfitted to trivial cases.
**Curious Beginner (service-oriented paradigm, biology analogy):** Request friendly services that behave like cooperative microbiomes offering rollback-as-a-service endpoints; tension point: list which services a newcomer must call directly.

### Cycle 3
**Visionary Futurist (event-sourcing paradigm, urban planning analogy):** Treat every DSL action as zoning permits stored in an event log, enabling reconstruction of any neighborhood; tension point: ensure event compaction keeps archives manageable.
**Seasoned Architect (layered architecture paradigm, pop fiction analogy):** Stack parsing, execution, rollback, and UI layers like the levels of *Inception*, each with strict contracts; tension point: prevent dream-layer leakage—cross-layer coupling.
**Improvisational Artist (metaprogramming paradigm, biology analogy):** Sculpt DSL macros as gene editors rewriting behavior safely inside the sandbox; tension point: decide how to sandbox meta-level edits without self-harm.
**Skeptical Critic (deterministic finite automata paradigm, urban planning analogy):** Argue for finite state modeling like turnstiles at subway stations to guarantee predictable rollbacks; tension point: reconcile finite models with potentially infinite DSL constructs.
**Curious Beginner (test-driven development paradigm, pop fiction analogy):** Beg for story-driven acceptance tests inspired by superhero training montages to validate rollback scenarios; tension point: figure out how to surface failing stories in plain language.

## Stage 2 — Self-Critique Loop

### Round 1: Composite Solution (Architect leads)
- Define modular layers: Parser, Analyzer, Executor, State Ledger, Rollback Orchestrator, UI hooks.
- Use event-sourced ledger storing immutable state diffs with compaction strategy.
- Provide reactive observability channels for timeline inspection, backed by actor-isolated execution contexts.
- Enforce constraint rules pre/post execution with deterministic automata checks.
- Document beginner-friendly service endpoints and story-driven tests.

### Round 2: Weaknesses & Assumptions (Critic leads)
- Event log growth may still overwhelm storage without adaptive pruning.
- Actor isolation could break when DSL operations require shared state locks.
- Constraint engine might become brittle if rules lag behind DSL evolution.
- Beginner services risk oversimplifying critical rollback configuration.
- Testing strategy depends on narratives that may not cover edge semantics.

### Round 3: Refinements (Architect + Artist)
- Introduce tiered compaction: periodic snapshots plus diff bucketing with configurable retention.
- Define shared resource broker mediating actor access via transactional boundaries.
- Build rule authoring DSL with safety nets to update constraints alongside language changes.
- Craft progressive disclosure UI where advanced rollback options unlock after tutorials.
- Combine story tests with property-based generators to expand semantic coverage.

### Round 4: Stress Tests (Futurist + Critic)
- High load: simulate thousands of concurrent DSL sessions to measure actor broker contention.
- Hostile input: fuzz parser and constraint DSL to ensure graceful degradation and rollbacks.
- Missing dependencies: run sandbox in degraded mode where optional plugins are stubbed yet rollbacks still succeed.
- Long-running sessions: validate compaction doesn’t corrupt reconstruction over millions of events.

### Round 5: Optimized Solution & Confidence
- Modular layering with event ledger and compaction [confidence 0.7].
- Actor execution with transactional broker [confidence 0.6].
- Constraint DSL with safety nets [confidence 0.65].
- Progressive disclosure services/UI [confidence 0.55].
- Hybrid narrative + property tests [confidence 0.6].

## Final Package
- **Architect’s Synthesized Plan:**
  - Implement parser/analyzer with hooks for constraint DSL integration.
  - Build executor atop actor contexts mediated by transactional broker.
  - Persist event ledger with snapshot/compaction pipeline and audit tooling.
  - Develop reactive timeline inspector UI with progressive disclosure controls.
  - Deliver dual-layer testing: story acceptance suite plus property generators.
- **North-Star Slogan:** "Sandbox boldly, rewind wisely: every DSL experiment remembered, none regretted."
